<-----------------------------------------BUILT WITH------------------------------------->
Semantic HTML 5 markup
CSS custom properties 
Flexbox
CSS grid 
<--------------------------------------WHAT I LEARNED------------------------------------>
I learned about the # symbol and why it's used in the href attribution. It is used when the user wants to specify a internal target location in the current document itself. 
About CSS, I learned a new customization property called z-index. It controls the stacking order of the selected elements. 
Another interesting information about CSS is the ::before. You can use that to creat pseudo-elements that is inserted before the content of a selected element. It is often used to add decorative content or icons to HTML elemenst, such as buttons or headers.

<----------------------------------------CONTINUED DEVELOPMENT------------------------>
I need to focus more on some points of CSS to learn how to deal with fast and assertive styling. I feel like I'm too slow in making decisions and how to implement certain measurement and color concepts. 

<------------------------------------------USEFUL RESOURCERS-------------------------->
